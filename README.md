# Fibonacci Challenge (/Competition if you want)

This is the first Programming Club competition in the 2024-2025 school year.
The goal is to compute **the highest Fibonacci number you possibly can in one second**.

You can use any language you'd like, but a template must be created first. Talk to me
if your language does not already have a template! The template will manage the timing
system.

You will be provided an arbitrary-precision integer object (which means there's no maximum
value you can have). You may modify the "big integer" object as much as you'd like, but it
must be able to convert to an exact number, be copyable, and convert to a string equivalent.
The string equivalent is used for the precision test (see further down). The default big
integer object is fairly efficient, but if you wish to upgrade it, you may.

**The Fibonacci numbers *MUST* be calculated sequentially!** You cannot skip to a high number,
you must start by calculating $F(1)$, then $F(2)$, $F(3)$, and so on.

In each template, there will be one method for you to implement: `Calculate(int index)`. The exact
appearance will change depending on the language. Any additional code cannot be modified, as it
runs the timing script.

There will also be an additional system to compare your Fibonacci outputs to their true values.
*Your Fibonacci numbers must all be correct!* The precision test will not be factored into the final
time, but all numbers must be proven correct or the time is disqualified.

Happy coding! If I forget to add anything, I'll edit this file.
